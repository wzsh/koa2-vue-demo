# Synthetical web development framework
This framework is combined with koa.js, sequelize.js, vue.js and element-ui.js.

I use this framework as a demo on the web prgramming mentoring in our lab.

## Usage
Clone this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/wzsh/koa2-vue-demo.git
```
Then, setup backend part:
```
> cd koa2-vue-demo\backend
> npm install
```
Run the backend:
```
> node app.js
```


On the other hand, setup frontend part:
```
> cd koa2-vue-demo\frontend
> npm install
```
Run the frontend:
```
> npm run dev
```

finally, open your browser with
```
http://localhost:8080
```
